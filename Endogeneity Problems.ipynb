    "Dep. Variable: The dependent variable in the model is \"Stock Change\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared: 0.015. This value is quite low, suggesting that the model explains only 1.5% of the variance in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adj. R-squared: 0.013. This is the adjusted R-squared, which adjusts for the number of independent variables in the model. It is very close to the R-squared, indicating that the number of variables is not inflating the explanatory power of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "F-statistic: 8.530. This is the overall F-test for the model, which tests whether at least one of the coefficients (excluding the intercept) is significantly different from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prob (F-statistic): 1.27e-05. This is the p-value associated with the F-statistic. A value close to 0 suggests that at least one of the coefficients in the model is significantly different from 0.\n",

    "2. Model Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Constant: The estimated coefficient for the constant term is -0.0176, but it is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.370).\n",
    "\n",
    "Endogenous Param: The estimated coefficient is 0.0011, with a p-value of 0.068. This suggests that there is some evidence that this variable is related to \"Stock Change\", but the evidence is not strong (a p-value less than 0.05 is typically considered strong evidence).\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating Profit: The estimated coefficient is -0.1201, and it is statistically significant (p-value < 0.001). This suggests a negative relationship between \"Operating Profit\" and \"Stock Change\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Interaction Effect: The estimated coefficient is 0.0014, and it is statistically significant (p-value < 0.001). This suggests a positive relationship between \"Interaction Effect\" and \"Stock Change\".\n",

    "Kurtosis: 9.811, indicating that the residuals have heavy tails.\n",

    "\n",
    "The model has a low R-squared value, indicating that it does not explain much of the variability in \"Stock Change\". The variable \"Operating Profit\" is negatively related to \"Stock Change\", and \"Interaction Effect\" is positively related to \"Stock Change\". \"Endogenous Param\" also shows a positive relationship, but it is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level.\n",
